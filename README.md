# Envoy OpenSSL Extensions

The Envoy OpenSSL Extensions project hosts extensions for building
[Envoy](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy) purely with OpenSSL.

## Building

To build OpenSSL-enabled Envoy run

```console
$ CXXFLAGS="-DENVOY_SSL_VERSION=\\\"OpenSSL\\\"" bazel build //:envoy --define boringssl=disabled
```

If you need OpenSSL dynamically linked to Envoy then re-map `@boringssl` to
`@openssl_shared` by editing the [WORKSPACE](WORKSPACE) file.
