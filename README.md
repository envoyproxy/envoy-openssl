# Envoy OpenSSL Extensions

The Envoy OpenSSL Extensions project hosts extensions for building
[Envoy](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy) purely with OpenSSL.
However, the code base is currently behind times and should not be used.
For the near future, the active part of this repository will be the
OpenSSL/BoringSSL compatibility library, which is being updated to cover
building the Envoy core against OpenSSL.
