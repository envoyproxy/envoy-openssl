Using the Envoy Docker Image
============================

The following examples use the :ref:`official Envoy Docker image <start_install_docker>`.

These instructions are known to work for the ``x86_64`` and ``arm64`` architectures.

Running Envoy with ``docker compose``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you would like to use Envoy with ``docker compose`` you can overwrite the provided configuration file
by using a volume.

.. substitution-code-block:: yaml

  version: '3'
  services:
    envoy:
      image: envoyproxy/|envoy_docker_image|
      ports:
        - "10000:10000"
      volumes:
        - ./envoy.yaml:/etc/envoy/envoy.yaml

If you use this method, you will have to ensure that the ``envoy`` user can read the mounted file
either by ensuring the correct permissions on the file, or making it world-readable, as described
below.


Build and run a Docker image
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create a simple Dockerfile to execute Envoy.

If you create a custom ``envoy.yaml`` you can create your own Docker image with it using the following
Dockerfile recipe:

.. substitution-code-block:: dockerfile

  FROM envoyproxy/|envoy_docker_image|
  COPY envoy.yaml /etc/envoy/envoy.yaml
  RUN chmod go+r /etc/envoy/envoy.yaml

Build the Docker image using:

.. code-block:: console

   $ docker build -t envoy:v1 .

Assuming Envoy is configured to listen on ports ``9901`` and ``10000``, you can now start it
with:

.. code-block:: console

   $ docker run -d --name envoy -p 9901:9901 -p 10000:10000 envoy:v1

Permissions for running Docker Envoy containers as a non-root user
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, the Envoy Docker image will start as the root user but will switch to the ``envoy``
user created at build time, in the Docker ``ENTRYPOINT``.

Alternatively, you can start the container specifying the Docker ``user``.

In this case the container will not attempt to drop privileges, but you will still need to ensure
that the user running inside the container has any required permissions, as described below.

Changing the ``uid`` and/or ``gid`` of the ``envoy`` user inside the container
******************************************************************************

The default ``uid`` and ``gid`` for the ``envoy`` user are ``101``.

The ``uid`` and ``gid`` of this user can be set at runtime using the ``ENVOY_UID`` and ``ENVOY_GID``
environment variables.

This can be done, for example, on the Docker command line:

.. substitution-code-block:: console

  $ docker run -d --name envoy -e ENVOY_UID=777 -e ENVOY_GID=777 envoyproxy/|envoy_docker_image|

This can be useful if you wish to restrict or provide access to ``unix`` sockets inside the container, or
for controlling access to an Envoy socket from outside of the container.

To run the process inside  the container as the ``root`` user you can set ``ENVOY_UID`` to ``0``,
but doing so has the potential to weaken the security of your running container.

Logging permissions inside the Envoy container
**********************************************

The ``envoy`` image sends application logs to ``/dev/stdout`` and ``/dev/stderr`` by default, and these
can be viewed in the container log.

If you send application, admin or access logs to a file output, the ``envoy`` user will require the
necessary permissions to write to this file. This can be achieved by setting the ``ENVOY_UID`` and/or
by making the file writeable by the envoy user.

For example, to mount a log folder from the host and make it writable, you can:

.. substitution-code-block:: console

  $ mkdir logs
  $ chown 777 logs
  $ docker run -d --name envoy -v $(pwd)/logs:/var/log -e ENVOY_UID=777 envoyproxy/|envoy_docker_image|

You can then configure ``envoy`` to log to files in ``/var/log``

Configuration and binary file permissions inside the Envoy container
********************************************************************

The ``envoy`` user also needs to have permission to access any required configuration files mounted
into the container.

Any binary files specified in the configuration should also be executable by the ``envoy`` user.

If you are running in an environment with a strict ``umask`` setting, you may need to provide ``envoy``
with access by setting the ownership and/or permissions of the file.

One method of doing this without changing any file permissions is to start the container with the
host user's ``uid``, for example:

.. substitution-code-block:: console

  $ docker run -d --name envoy -v $(pwd)/envoy.yaml:/etc/envoy/envoy.yaml -e ENVOY_UID=$(id -u) envoyproxy/|envoy_docker_image|

Listen only on ports > 1024 inside the Docker Envoy container
*************************************************************

Unix-based systems restrict opening ``well-known`` ports (ie. with a port number < ``1024``) to the ``root`` user.

If you need to listen on a ``well-known`` port you can use Docker to do so.

For example, to create an Envoy server listening on port ``8000``, with forwarding from port ``80``:

.. substitution-code-block:: console

  $ docker run -d --name envoy -p 80:8000 envoyproxy/|envoy_docker_image|
